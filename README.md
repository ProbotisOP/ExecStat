# xst: The Command Line's Tiny Telemetry Titan

## What is xst?

`xst` is your command line's personal fitness tracker. It's like having a tiny, lightning-fast accountant that tells you exactly how much CPU sweat, RAM calories, and time your commands are burning!

## Why xst?

Because ignorance isn't bliss when it comes to performance! `xst` lets you:

- Catch resource-hogging commands red-handed
- Impress your tech friends with exact command execution times
- Finally answer the age-old question: "Is my computer slow, or is it just me?"

## Installation

To install `xst`, run:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProbotisOP/ExecStat/main/xst.bash | bash
